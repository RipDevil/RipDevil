### Hi! :tada:

_My name is Mark and I am a javascript enthusiast._

Currently working at Yandex. After work I love to code something â€“ pet projects are:
- :fire: [FUQ](https://github.com/RipDevil/client-FUQs)
- :tomato: [Tomnato](https://www.tomnato.ru/) - my personal webpage with articles and my info
- :white_large_square: [happy-squares](https://github.com/RipDevil/happy-squares) - a fun project which allows you to see your git progress in a project
